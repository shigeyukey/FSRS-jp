My representative paper at ACMKDD: [A Stochastic Shortest Path Algorithm for Optimizing Spaced Repetition Scheduling](http://www.maimemo.com/paper/)

My fantastic research experience on spaced repetition algorithm: [How did I publish a paper in ACMKDD as an undergraduate?](https://medium.com/@JarrettYe/how-did-i-publish-a-paper-in-acmkdd-as-an-undergraduate-c0199baddf31?source=friends_link&sk=de3ccb28e7db7dcbf1152f967669ebcb)

The largest open-source dataset on spaced repetition with time-series features: [open-spaced-repetition/FSRS-Anki-20k](https://huggingface.co/datasets/open-spaced-repetition/FSRS-Anki-20k)
